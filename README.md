This project aims to investigate the following questions:  
1. Do viruses with certain transmission types have higher mutation rates than others?  
  Certain transmission methods may require more replication than others, increasing the chances of mutations. As a result, these viruses would have higher mutation rates, and would likely have greater differences between lineages.

2. Is viral mutation rate correlated with guanine-cytosine content?  
  GC content in DNA correlates positively with codon usage and expression efficiency, though this has not been investigated in RNA (Auewarakul, 2005). In addition, GC content in yeast is positively correlated with mutation and recombination rates, so this may also be the case in other microbial organisms such as viruses (Kiktev et al., 2018).
